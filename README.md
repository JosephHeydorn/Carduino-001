# Carduino-001
This project is created using Arduino C. Make sure when you upload the file to the actual arduino/FONA808 that you are using arduino C. Github does not yet have the option to set the code to arduino C yet so it is currently set as C. Also do not forget to put your phone number in the designated place so that you can recive the texts from the device.
